We present to your attention a simple text analyzer.

The SEO analyzer checks the text based on the following parameters:

+ Number of words 
+ Spam level 
+ Water content 
+ Density of each keyword 
+ Overall keyword density 
+ Rating based on keywords in headings Rating for keywords at the beginning of the text
+ Overall score
+ The script also provides an assessment of the positioning of keywords in the text.

To calculate the "water" in the text, the "text entropy" can be used.

The text is entered separately (in the script it is denoted as $text['content']) as well as the keywords in the form of an array in the variable $keywords.

You can see the operation of the script on the website https://greenballoon.ru/nejroseti/generator-teksta-s-iskusstvennym-intellektom

Enter the text in the editor and click "Text Analysis." The operation of this script is located under "Additional."
